CNN to identify kelp cover from satellite imagery from NASA's open-source LANDSAT dataset

provided:
- CNN code in "model.py"
- training data of 300+ multispectral images in "train.zip"
- test data of multispectral imagery in "test" folder

future improvements:
- larger dataset of satellite imagery
- cross-comparison of various CNN architectures
- identification of other aquatic life (e.g. algae, phytoplankton)
